# Tetrisuino
A Tetris game built from scratch for Arduino with an OLED display and controlled by a joystick.

The setup consists of an Arduino Mega 2560 (Uno works as well) connected to an SSD1306 OLED display (128x64px) via I2C, a joystick for movement control, a button to hold pieces, and an RGB LED for status indication.
